# Moroccan style chicken in citrus vinaigrette

## Ingredients

### Citrus vinaigrette

- 1 orange
- 1 mandarin
- 1 lemon
- 1 lime
- 1.5 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 3/4 cup EVOO
- Salt and pepper

Zest citrus before squeezing the juices. Mix all together.

* Vinaigrette recipe from Six Seasons by Joshua McFadden
* Vinaigrette can keep in the fridge for two weeks, and be used with other
  things, for example to dress a salad, or drizzle over grilled prawns.

### Stew

- 1 red onion, roughly chopped
- 4 garlic, sliced
- 1 red capsicum - sliced into strips
- 4 chicken thighs
- 10 pitted prunes
- Pinch of cumin
- Pinch of turmeric
- 1 cinnamon stick
- Salt and pepper
- Rice bran oil

--
1. Heat up the oil, and add the onions and garlic. Sprinkle with cumin and
   turmeric and fry until fragrant and soft, about 2-4 minutes.
1. Add the capsicum.
1. Once the capsicum is starting to soften, add the chicken and turn a few times
   to seal each side.
1. Once the chicken is golden and almost cooked through, add the citrus
   vinaigrette, enough to almost cover the chicken.
   Also add the cinnamon stick, prunes, and season with salt and pepper.
1. Reduce heat, cover the pot and cook until the juices in the pan have reduced,
   and the chicken almost falls apart.

### Couscous

- 1 cup of couscous
- 1 cup of boiling water
- 1 tbsp of butter (alternative: margarine or olive oil)

Mix together in a bowl, and leave covered. After a few minutes, use a fork to
fluff up and separate the couscous.

### Serving

- Fresh coriander leaves, chopped
- Slivered almonds, toasted

Serve the chicken stew on top of the couscous,
and top with chopped coriander and slivered almonds.
