   Place the butter in the empty core.
   Sprinkle with the brown sugar.
3. Bake for 20-25 minutes,
   depending on the apple size and your desired consistency.
4. Rest out of the oven for 5 minutes.
   Then cut to chunks, and serve topped with

## Aside

- Look for Fuji, Dalinette, or Gala apples.
- You can replace the butter and sugar with maple syrup.
- You can also replace the yoghurt and cinnamon sugar
  with a little drizzle of maple syrup for serving.
- You can pop the apples in the oven just before you sit down to eat.
  The smell from the oven will help convince small people to come to the table.
