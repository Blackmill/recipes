# Saut√©ed mushrooms

## Ingredients

- A bunch of mushrooms, sliced
- 1 garlic clove, sliced
- 2 tsp salt-reduced soy sauce
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- Salt and black pepper
- Olive oil

Yield: 3 serves

## Cookware

- Fry pan

## Directions

1. Mix the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and sugar together.
1. Heat up the oil in a fry pan over medium-high heat.
   Add garlic first until the garlic begins to sizzle but not brown,
   about 30 seconds. Then add the mushrooms, stir,
   and fry for another 30 seconds to a minute.
1. Add the sauces mix, season with salt and pepper,
   and fry for a few minutes until all moisture is evaporated,
   and the mushrooms begin to brown.

## Aside

I usually serve these mushrooms with fried eggs for breakfast.

If you're in the mood for pasta, instead of the sauces mix; fry the garlic,
then mushrooms, then add a splash of white wine, 1/4 cup of cream,
and 3 tablespoons of grated cheese.
