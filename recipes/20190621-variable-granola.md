# Variable Granola

## Base

- 2.5-3 cups of rolled oats

## Dry ingredients options

Choose two:

- 1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
- 1/2-1 cup spelt puffs
- 1/2-1 cup uncooked quinoa
- 1/2-1 cup raw buckwheat groats
- 1/2-1 popped amaranth

## Nuts options

Choose as many as you'd like:

- Raw almonds - slivered or flakes
- Pumpkin seeds
- Sunflower seeds
- Pecans
- Walnuts
- Any other nuts or seeds you have around...

## Seasonings

- 1/4 tsp salt (preferably flaky)

The rest are optional and depends on what you feel like this week:

- 1-3 tbsp cane sugar (or coconut sugar, or white...)
- 3/4-1 tsp of ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp Vanilla extract

## Wet sweet ingredients

For 3 cups of rolled oats, you want about 1/2 cup
of wet mix to coat the oats through.

Add 1/4 cup of one of these:

- Maple syrup
- Golden syrup
- Agave nectar
- Honey
- 3 tbsp of natural salted peanut butter (or almond butter)
  - if using this, add to maple syrup
    and heat both up for a few seconds to mix well
 
## Wet fat ingredients

Add 1/4 cup of one of these:

- Olive oil
- Coconut oil
- Avocado oil

If you prefer to make granola based mainly on salt and olive oil,
increase olive oil amount to 1/2 cup, and flaky salt to 1 tsp.
Then use with 3 tbsp of sugar.

## Five minutes before baking is complete, add

Choose up to two of these:

- Raisins (sultanas)
- Dried cranberries
- Dried blueberries
- Dried apricot, chopped
- Dried figs, chopped
- Dried bananas
- Dried Mangoes
- Any other type of dried fruit...

## If you have a sweet tooth

After the baking is done,
add 1/3 cup dairy-free dark chocolate (roughly chopped bar or bits)

## Instructions

1. Heat oven up to 350F/180C.
1. Mix base with dry ingredients and seasonings.
   Mix wet ingredients together, pour over the mixture until coated well. 
1. I usually mix everything in the actual baking tray.
   Otherwise, now is the time to transfer everything to a baking tray,
   spread evenly, and transfer to the oven.
1. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Half way through the bake, shuffle the mix around.
1. 5 minutes before baking is complete, stir in your choice of dried fruit.
1. The mixture will look not dry by the end of bake, and that's fine.
   It should have a light to deep golden colour.
1. Remove from the oven and let cool completely.
   If you like chunky granola, leave as is.
   Otherwise, shuffle the mixture again now, to prevent it drying and sticking in chunks.
1. Store in an airtight container. It should keep for 3-4 weeks.
