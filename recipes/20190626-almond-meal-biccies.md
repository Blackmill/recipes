# Almond meal biccies

## Ingredients

- 100g almond meal (or oatmeal) (3/4 cup)
- 60g butter at room temperature (1/2 cup)
- 30g rolled oats (1/4 cup)
- 1 egg yolk
- 2 tbsp coconut sugar (or cane, or brown)
- Flour for dusting
- Oil spray

## Yield

Depends on your cookie cutter size, this made 9 biccies on my medium size
cutter.

## Tools

- Bowl
- Spoon
- Baking tray
- Baking (parchment) paper
- Rolling pin
- Cookie cutter
- Wire tray

## Directions

1. Heat the oven up to 350F/180C.
1. Line a baking try with baking paper, and spray with oil.
1. In a bowl, mix together almond meal, butter, rolled oats, and sugar.
   Use your fingertips to mix until the butter is absorbed.
1. Add the egg yolk and this time mix it in with a spoon.
   The dough should be pretty sticky. Season with a bit of salt.
1. Dust your workbench. Roll out the dough to about 7mm thick,
   and cut out as many rounds as possible.
   Roll the leftover dough and repeat until it is all used.
1. Place on baking tray, and bake for about 15-20 minutes,
   until the edges are golden brown.
   Then cool on a wire tray before serving.
1. Store in an airtight container for up to 10 days.

## Aside

Use with rolled oats (instead of almond meal)
that you ran through a food processor for an oatcake version.
Both versions go well with cheddar cheese.
