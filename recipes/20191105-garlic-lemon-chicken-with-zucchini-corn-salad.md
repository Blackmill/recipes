Yield: 3

## Cookware

- Chef's knife
- 2 fry pans - preferably cast iron or carbon steel
- 3 mixing bowls
- Garlic mincer
- Citrus juicer (optional)
- Cutting board - one for chicken and one for veggies
- Measuring spoons
- tongs

## Marinade and salad dressing

- 4 garlic cloves, smashed
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 2 tsp brown sugar
- Salt and pepper
- Parsley leaves, chopped

1. Mix and separate into two bowls

## Marinaded chicken

- 3 chicken thighs
- Olive oil

2. Cut the chicken thighs into desirable chunks
   (either bite size or slightly bigger)
   and add to one of the bowls to marinade for a few minutes.
3. Heat up the oil in a pan.
   Add the chicken with the marinade and fry on medium heat
   until the chicken is cooked.

## Salad

- 1 zucchini
- 200g frozen corn (optionally slice kernels from 1 corn cob)
- 100g crumbled feta
- Olive oil

4. While the chicken is marinating,
   wash and discard the end of the zucchini, then dice to small pieces.
   Add to bowl with corn and mix.
5. Heat up the oil in the second pan on medium-high heat.
   Add the zucchini and corn mixture.
   Cook, stirring occasionally
   until the vegetables are softened and lightly browned,
   about 4 minutes.
   Add most of the salad dressing to the pan, bring the heat up to high,
   and cook for a couple more minutes until the vegetables are slightly charred.
6. Return the veggies to the mixing bowl.
   Add the feta and the rest of the dressing and stir to combine.

## To serve

- Cherry tomatoes, halved
- Parsley leaves
- 50g slivered almonds (optional)

7. Chop the parsley leaves
8. Toast the almonds in a small frying pan on low heat for a few minutes.
   Watch out they do not burn.
9. Place the chicken, salad, and cherry tomatoes on the plate.
10. Sprinkle the salad with toasted almonds and chopped parley leaves.

## Aside

- You can replace the parsley with fresh oregano or rosemary leaves.
- The toasted slivered almonds are optional but add a nice crunch to the salad.
- The tomatoes add a bit of colour and tangy flavour to the dish.
  You can replace the tomatoes with any other fresh or steamed veggie.
  For example chopped cucumber, capsicum, avocado.
  Or steamed carrots, green beans, peas, broccoli...
