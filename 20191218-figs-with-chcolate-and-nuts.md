# Figs with dark chocolate, nuts and pomegranate seeds

## Ingredients

- 4 figs
- 4-8 cubes of dark chocolate (or white)
- 3 pitted dates
- 2-3 tbsp slivered almonds
- Pomegranate seeds (or pistachios)
- A dollop of ice cream

Yield: 4 serves

## Cookware

- Mini food processor

## Directions

1. Wash fresh figs in cool water.
   Place the figs on a cutting board and slice off their stems.
   Slice the fruit lengthwise into quarters
   (or thinner slices/ or chop into smaller pieces if desired).
   Place the figs on serving plates.
2. Place dark chocolate, dates, and slivered almonds in the food processor,
   and pulse into small bits.
3. Top the figs with the nut mixture, a dollop of ice cream, pomegranate seeds,
   and a few more slivered almonds.

## Aside

I originally served this
with white chocolate (grated and melted) and pistachios,
but this time I didn't have either of these ingredients in the house,
so I improvised.
